Deploying the application using Docker
1: install docker the easiest way to do it https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/
2: run " sudo docker build -t vendor-hub-frontend .  "
3: then run  " sudo docker run -it  vendor-hub-frontend ""
4: OptOptionally = can just run this single command " sudo docker build -t vendor-hub-frontend .   &&   sudo docker run -it  vendor-hub-frontend "
Running the commands above will build and launch the app on a port if for some reason changes made are not updated you can run the above commands by using the flag " sudo docker build -t vendor-hub-frontend . --no-cache

 "
 To run a specific port you can run sudo docker run -it -p 3000:3000 vendor-hub-frontend
